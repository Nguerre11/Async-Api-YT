!important -> 2 Recourse within of folder recourses-encodings. The 3 its physicall system within coming soon in the folder too.

##Workflow 
1 Planning system 
    Assign syllabus to Excel spreadsheet
    Estimate hours per syllabus including margin of error (reviews - practice)
2.Pre-learning system (1 layer encoding) [1H]
    Select Index Global 
    Separate them by global themes (Git - GitHub)
    Create an accurate index of the themes (class-until-class number)
3.Atopic learning [2H] 
    Review Videos El  (don't need this step for this course)
    Analysis → creation of high-level learning hypotheses 
        Review Open AI 
        Why is it important? 
        Can I relate them? 
        Can I simplify them? 
        Can I categorize them into fragments? 
        I've finished Big Picture? (I've just create relations on this folder, don't draw organization system)

Learning Workflow (2 layer encoding) [+20H] if Class==conceptual-comprehension, else omit it
    1.Trends Index (not necessary)
        Video 2.0X
        a.Identify where is "conceptual comprehension" 
        b. Apply high order learning encoding (do not
        memorize or understand, relate, compare and
        organize)
        b. Identify the key points
        c. I stop it when I've got "conceptual comprehension"
        Code within the organization system (Big Picture) (layer 1)
    2.Atopic learning (Quick review of multiple sources) if Class==code-comprehension
        Review Forum
        Select Summary
        Understand it
        Use Open AI to reinforce
        Reinforce Big Picture (layer 2)
    3.Comprehension Workflow and practical application
        Divide Big Picture - Workflow by theme
        Video 1.0X"
        Focus on comprehension  "code comprehension"
        Relate and create a 1-layer coding workflow
        Program at the end of class. !important
    4.Design Workflow coding 2 layer + Accumulative project (optional)
        Step-by-step system of a definitive goal    
        Design Workflow .js files and readme
        Create documentation based on this.
    5. Feedback Loop What did u useful?
        Translate through Open AI
        English Open AI
        Relate things to pre-learning progress
        View once video 1.0X
        test code throughout of class
        pratique-end

##Line-code to apply 🔑
`$()` add values for strings
!
|| something
+= increment any number 
var result = numero === 2 ? "true" : "falses"; // different accomplishment to do if 
break; default: placed by switch

##Targets to lesson 🧠 
    1. to display none if mobile-Open !x2✅
    2.to display none if  desktop-menu Open x1 :che
    3.to display block if click card-icon ✅
##List cards-products
    1.Create array complete
    2.Create elements to layout 
    3.Layout as like html 
    4. Save through
##details-product-toggle
    1.to open with any product and close with X ✅
    2.to display none if Mobile-desktop-Cart-Open 
    3.responsive design with 100%
##json1 , json2 
1. output default with ();
2. spread operator json1 [] and json 2 normal 
##odd Numbers from async functions and Set-timeout
1.resolve == odd number 
2. reject == error odd
3.each 4 seconds output a resolve or reject 
4. deadline i = 20; 


    
##What did I learn?
    Identify when I got passive learning 
    omit until find key-word out getting curiosity 
    Generate hypotheses through key-words list
###How to recall information-not-practice
    videos to teach them all 
    post to blog or readme learning 
    audio-sums to recall anywhere 
###What did I learn? (learn fastest way)
    You won't scientific,but you'll a resolver person. 
    CS50 Harvard is the most fundamental introduction.
    DEVpost inspirations projects

##Pre-learning 
    key-words with AI 
    relate important key-words
    create hypotheses
    design organization system
##Learning
    evaluate hypotheses
    add deep accompaniments or information
    practice immediately code

    ###Functions
        function declaration
        bunch of code will be executed 
        invoke the function
    ###Conditions if
        Conditions declaration
        value false or true 
        bear bloq code if its true 
    ##Loops for 
    for (initialization; condition; iteration) { code to be executed
    for (variable of iterable of Arrays) {// code to be executed
    ##Arrays recorridos (complex)
        are methods used for filter, they dont modifique the main arrays
        var.complexArray= mainArray(function);
